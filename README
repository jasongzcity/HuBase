Welcome to HuBase

I create this database for learning/fun purposes. I have been thinking and preparing to implement a database for some time. 
While writing HuBase, I have two references: the book Database System Implementation and the source code of SQLite3. 
So, HuBase will have the architecture like SQLite3.

Also, the database can only run on UNIX (use POSIX & standard I/O only), so that I can get rid of the multi-platform problems :-)).  


TODO: add more introductions for each module later.
